# Foodie
An Android application that can help you decide what to make with the left over ingredients you have!

# How does it work?
You can open the application and click pictures of the ingredients. The app sends a request to Google's Cloud Vision API and gets back results as to what the object could be. The user can choose from the top 15 results. After adding the ingredients manually or by clicking pictures, the ingredients are used to fetch recipes from the food2fork API.
